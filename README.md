### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Yue and welcome to my GitHub repository. 

A little about me, I'm a software engineer with a BS in computer science. Like many fellow engineers these days, my love for programming stems from gaming. 
In 2007, when I was still in middle school, I saw first hand how a monster, in a video game, was created through a single function call. 
It seemed so simple, yet surprisingly complex; from there, I was hooked!

Feel free to stay a while and browse my repos.
